<h3>this one was a lot of fun. i basically just wore tight pants & played bass on the track. i believe the idea was to call back to the classic Beverly Hills 90210 opening credits. really funny. i didnt get any reference because i've never watched that show.</h3>

<h1>xmas ~ you can leave me whenever you want

<h3>[CW: suicide] adel & i worked together on this video from her idea of two lovers/friends: one keeps trying to end their life & the other keeps saving them from it.
there's nothing very graphic in it. we were watching a lot of buster keaton and harold lloyd videos together at the time.
the style of those films influenced how we approached this dark subject. we are cartoons, in the world of the film, & perhaps in our own worlds too...</h3>
