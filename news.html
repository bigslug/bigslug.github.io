<br>Hi there! This is my very first update.
<p>This area will be a place for news about my creative projects as well as just kinda general updates about my life. I do use social media, but i feel worse & worse about it every day. I'd like to see a future where everyone just has their own website.
	<br>Mostly i just post art & pics on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/the_lookin_machine/">instagram</a>.
<br>
<br>Anyways... my cat just had kittens... aaand it's hot in Seattle right now... aaand that is all for now!</p>
<p>bye bye!</p>
