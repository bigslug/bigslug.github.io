  <!--- <br>i am artist working in several different mediums,
   including sequential arts (comics, animation), screenprinting, graphic design, 
   electronic music, drawing, painting, songwriting, & music production. 
   <br>âœ¤
   <br>i live in seattle. i am a 31 year old transexual woman.
   <br>\\
   <br>
   <br>i grew up in titusville, fl, which is the town closest to Kennedy Space Center.
   <br>i first started making comics when i was 9 years old. i was obsessed with Captain Underpants and 
   Calvin & Hobbes. i also watched a lot of Dragon Ball and Sonic on tv & you could tell if you read those comics.
   <br>i would draw them during the day & then give them to my dad to print copies at work. 
   the next morning i would staple them together while i ate my cereal before school.
   <br>i made serials and trading cards and i sold them to my friends at recess.
   <br>
   <br>later, i stopped making comics and focused on being a "good" artist. i also got really into smoking weed & hanging out with
   skaters. i was too uncoordinated to do much of anything other than push around, but the skaters were nicer than other boys 
   at school and sometimes there were girls hanging around who were maybe older & into cool music. some of my friends were really good skaters!
   <br>as a despised skater streetrat, my artistic output dropped but i developed the beginnings of a political understanding, as well as aesthetic & musical tastes.
   <br>
   <br>i still drew incessantly & filled margins of my class notes to the brim with doodles & sketches
   <br>but, i didn't practice art in any focused sense again until my last two years of highschool (2008-2010), when friends and i discovered diy music, 
   namely the roster of plan-it-x records & its satelite bands. the thought that anyone write some simple songs, record them onto a laptop, make cds,
   and then drive around playing "shows" to other kids -- that we could even set up our own shows, with or without adults around... this was mind-blowing, 
   and diy music -- show-running, songwriting, playing, hosting, flyering, touring -- occupied my life more or less for the better part of a decade.
   <br>during this period i also picked up art and comics again, developing a visual language, toyed with perspective, & investigated narrative. 
   <br>i was also attended the school of art at Florida State in Tallahassee. 
   <br>
   <br>i eventually quit school to travel and focus on my art & music. i ended up in seattle -- first renting an attic, then moving into a real room -- 
   and i've stuck around since. for a while i was doing a lot of touring and playing shows with my band, guests, and my friends' band, flying fish cove. 
   <br>these days i mostly hang at my apartment drawing comics or teaching myself printmaking, with my intern, which is what i call my building-mate & friend's cat: Worm.
   <br>we also call her Baby. she likes to chew up paper & sometimes even gets at originals.
