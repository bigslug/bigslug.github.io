<br><h1>About Who?</h1>
<br><img src="pic-1 copy.png" width="400px" alt="pic of jean holding coffee cup" title="me">
<p>hi! my name is jean canfield & this is my website. here i collect, archive, 
  & share my work. 
  <br>
  <br>âœ¤
  <p>a little about myself: 
  <br>i am artist working in several different mediums,
   including sequential arts (comics, animation), screenprinting, graphic design, 
   electronic music, drawing, painting, songwriting, & music production. 
   <br>âœ¤
   <br>i live in seattle. i am 31 years old.
   <br>i am a nonbinary, queer transsexual woman. the pronouns i use are "they/them".
   <br>âœ¤
   <br>i am a snob about orange juice, pizza, coffee, & bagels. that's about it tho.
    <br>i grew up organizing diy shows around my florida bust-town in the 
    <br>shadow of the Kennedy Space Center.
    <br>later, i attended Florida State University & studied studio art with a focus on drawing. 
    <br>i am a proud art school dropout & i despise the elitism insitutional learning engenders in the arts & the workplace.
    <br>i have toured the states with a band, as well as just kind of drifted around/living out of my car for periods.
    <br>âœ¤
    <br>these days i mostly hang at home and read and draw and write songs with my assistant, Worm, the cat.
    <br>she also goes by Baby, Bambino, Babs, Barbara, etc. 
  <br>i like quiet forests, incredibly loud live music, sandy beaches, rocky beaches, 
  ruins, creatures, graffiti, radical theory/history/praxis, queer lit, freaky art, 
  cinema, & living free wild life.
  <br>âœ¤
  <br>i sometimes accept freelance jobs. some examples of past work can be found <a href="https://birdflyingbelowtheground.wordpress.com/">here</a>.
